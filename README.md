#COVID-19 in Colombia

*BogotÃ¡, Abril 5 de 2020* >
This is a basic Python script that uses the official info published by
Colombia's National Institute of Helath (INS), and peforms a series of basic
data analysis.

###CHARACTERISTICS OF INS DATA

>

[INS publishes data in CSV format here](https://e.infogram.com/01266038-4580-4cf0-baab-a532bd968d0c?parent_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ins.gov.co%2FNoticias%2FPaginas%2FCoronavirus.aspx&src=embed#)

Nevertheless CSV data is created "on the fly" by a script that runs when one
hit the "Download data" link, so till now I haven't been able to programatically
download the CSV file, so it has to be downloaded manually.
